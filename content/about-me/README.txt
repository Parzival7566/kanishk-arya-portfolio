Hey there! I'm Kanishk, a passionate computer engineering student with a knack for all things AI and machine learning. Ever since diving into the world of algorithms and data, I've been hooked on building innovative solutions that make a real-world impact.

I thrive on tackling exciting challenges, which is why I've dedicated myself to internships at companies like Accrete.AI and AI4Bharat, where I honed my skills in computer vision, OCR development, and document understanding. I'm always eager to expand my knowledge, constantly exploring new technologies and pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

When I'm not coding up a storm, you can find me collaborating on academic projects like ViziAssist, a road obstacle detection system, or SkillSet Sherpa, a career guidance chatbot. I believe in the power of technology to improve lives, and I'm driven to create meaningful solutions that benefit others.

Let's connect and build something amazing together!
